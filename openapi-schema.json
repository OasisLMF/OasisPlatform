    # Workflow
    The general workflow is as follows

    1. Authenticate your client, either supply your username and password to the `/access_token/`
       endpoint or make a `post` request to `/refresh_token/` with the `HTTP_AUTHORIZATION` header
       set as `Bearer <refresh_token>`.
    2. Create a portfolio (post to `/portfolios/`).
    3. Add a locations file to the portfolio (post to `/portfolios/<id>/locations_file/`)
    4. Create the model object for your model (post to `/models/`).
    5. Create an analysis (post to `/portfolios/<id>/create_analysis`). This will generate the input files
       for the analysis.
    6. Add analysis settings file to the analysis (post to `/analyses/<pk>/analysis_settings/`).
    7. Run the analysis (post to `/analyses/<pk>/run/`)
    8. Get the outputs (get `/analyses/<pk>/output_file/`)
