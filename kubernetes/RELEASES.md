# Release notes

## Sprint 1

Released on 2021-09-17

**Features included:**

* Helm charts to deploy, upgrade and manage services in Kubernetes.
* Helm chart for the platform. This includes:
    * Oasis server, agent, controller, worker monitor and UI.
    * Broker and databases (redis & postgres).
    * Keycloak (for new authentication and user management to be implemented later).
    * Prometheus (collects metrics).
    * Grafana (a complement to Prometheus for a better and easier way to visualize metrics and dashboards).
* Helm chart for models and workers.
* Helm chart for monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana.
    * Includes a custom Oasis dashboard in Grafana to monitor kubernetes nodes, pods and workers.
* Ingress.
* Deployment instructions.

**This covers the following in the functional summary:**

* Most of Kubernetes architecture (1.1) except for:
    * Ingress & API - ingress supported but split over two hostnames. Using one will require changes in either oasis ui
      or oasis server.
    * Health checks - basic checks in place, works very well but will be improved.
    * RabbitMQ / Mysql support - Current helm charts use redis / postgres.
* Model deployment (1.3)

## Sprint 2

Released on 2021-10-01

**Features included:**

* Autoscaler
    * New application located in kubernetes/worker_controller/.
    * Supports three scaling configurations:
        * Fixed number of workers.
        * Dynamic scaling based on the number of analyses currently running. One worker is started per analysis.
        * Dynamic scaling based on the sum of all submitted tasks per model.
* Platform chart improvements:
    * Autoscaler added.
    * Ingress controller supports custom tls certificate.
* Platform improvements:
    * Swagger fix to support https if access through the kubernetes ingress.
* Updated documentation.

**This covers the following in the functional summary:**

* Implement Autoscaling in kubernetes (1.2)

**Important notes:**

Ticket: https://github.com/OasisLMF/OasisPlatform/issues/542

Two issues were found with the websocket response and will impact testing before resolved. The autoscaler might shutdown
workers incorrectly before these are fixed, but I think this mostly affects parallel runs.

## Sprint 3

Released on 2021-10-15

**Features included:**

* Platform chart improvements:
    * Authentication setting: keycloak (default) or simple jwt
    * Default oasis keycloak realm setup on install (default accounts, settings etc.)
* Platform improvements:
    * Support Keycloak as authentication backend (extended mozilla_django_oidc).
    * Replicates Keycloak user/roles on the fly to Django user/groups.
    * Swagger keycloak support with instructions.
    * Auth endpoints works with Keycloak enabled for backward compatibility.
* Updated documentation.

**This covers the following in the functional summary:**

* Most of Improved security and user-management (1.4) except for:
    * Role isolation.

## Sprint 4

Released on 2021-10-29

**Features included:**

* Platform chart improvements:
    * The default user account gets group **admin**
    * A new service account is created also with group **admin**. This account is used by the model registration to
      update models and the worker controller to manage deployments.
* Platform improvements:
    * Model, portfolios and data files now supports groups.
        * Only users of the same group can see and modify those objects.
        * Groups are managed in Keycloak and migrated to django.
    * Analyses inherit their groups from the portfolio but a user also needs to be part of the model group to be able to
      run/cancel the analysis.
* Updated documentation.

**This covers the following in the functional summary:**

* Second part of Improved security and user-management (1.4):
    * Group/role isolation.

## Sprint 5

Released on 2021-11-26

**Features included:**

* Platform chart improvements:
    * New worker controller settings:
        * `workerController.totalWorkerLimit`: A limit for the total number of workers (for all models) the worker
          controller are allowed to create.
        * `workerController.priority.modelsLimit`: This is only used when there are multiple runs with different
          priorities set. The worker controller will limit the number of models and only create workers for the models
          for the top priority runs. For example a value of `2` creates workers for the 2 models with analyses with the
          highest priority.
    * Changed the default keycloak user to 'admin' (same name as default django user)
    * Updated health checks to read secrets instead of directly from chart values.
    * All celery task deployment now has a celery ping health check.
    * Support for Mysql as an alternative to Postgres.
    * Ingress now only use one hostname.
    * Redis replaced by RabbitMQ.
* Monitoring chart improvements:
  * Flower is now available for monitoring celery.
* Platform improvements:
    * Analysis priority:
        * A priority (10-10) can be set on each analysis:
          * 10 - The highest priority
          * 8, 9, 10 - Requires admin account
          * 4 - Default priority
          * 1 - The lowest priority
        * Priority is set on Celery tasks
        * New configuration:
          ```
          # Levels that require admin account to use
          ANALYSIS_PRIORITY_ADMIN_LEVELS = [8, 9, 10]
          ```
        * Worker controller respects the new settings in the platform chart.
    * Oasis servers health check endpoint now checks celery and database connectivity.
    * Moved server endpoints into subpath /app to be able to use the same ingress hostname for all services.
* Updated documentation.

**This covers the following in the functional summary:**

* Job prioritization (1.5):
* Finished health checks and mysql support (not fully implemented in 1.1 / sprint 1)

## Sprint 6

Released on 2021-12-10

**Features included:**

* Platform chart improvements:
  * RabbitMQ ack timeout disabled (introduced in 3.8.15)
* Platform improvements:
  * Enabled retry for worker tasks - A failed task will be run again 2 times.
* Verified that the platform recovers from:
  * Randomly failed worker tasks - Each task will be retried 2 times before it is marked as failed.
  * Lost database connection - celery will reconnect and retry the task.
  * Disk error - Each task will be retried 2 times before it is marked as failed.
  * Lost worker - task is picked up by other worker.

**This covers the following in the functional summary:**

* Improved worker resilience to disconnection/failure (1.6)
